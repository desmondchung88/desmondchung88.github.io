## 🛡️ Phishing Email Detection System

### Project Overview
As part of a team project, I developed a Python-based security tool designed to detect and classify phishing attempts. The system analyzes email headers, body content, and URLs to assign a **Risk Score**, classifying emails as *Safe*, *Suspicious*, or *Phishing*.

This project focuses on **feature engineering** and **heuristic analysis** to identify social engineering attacks that bypass traditional filters.

### 🔍 Key Detection Features

The system utilizes a multi-layered approach to analyze threats:

#### 1. Sender Identity Verification
* **Whitelist Validation:** Instant cross-check against a predefined list of trusted domains.
* **Levenshtein Edit Distance:** Calculates string distance to detect "typosquatting" (e.g., `g0ogle.com` vs `google.com`).
* **Fuzzy Matching:** Flags sender names that visually mimic trusted brands using fuzzy string similarity.
* **Spoofing Detection:** Identifies display names that suspiciously resemble email addresses.

#### 2. Content & Semantic Analysis
* **Keyword Risk Scoring:** Scans for urgency triggers (e.g., "Verify", "Urgent") with weighted scoring based on position (Subject line vs. Body).
* **HTML Forensics:** Detects risky HTML tags, embedded scripts, and hidden forms often used in credential harvesting.
* **Character Distribution:** Flags obfuscation attempts, such as excessive punctuation or repeated symbols.

#### 3. URL & External Intelligence
* **Suspicious Link Detection:** Identifies mismatched domains (text vs. actual link) and raw IP addresses.
* **VirusTotal API Integration:** Real-time reputation checks for URLs against vendor security databases.

### 📊 Performance & Visualization

We moved beyond simple detection by implementing a comprehensive data analysis suite:

* **Confusion Matrix:** To visualize True Positives vs. False Positives.
* **Metrics:** calculated Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Accuracy.
* **Interactive Charts:** Bar charts and data tables to analyze feature correlation.

### 🧠 Method: The Risk Scoring Engine

The core of our application is the **Final Risk Scoring** algorithm. It aggregates weighted scores from all detection modules.

> **Logic:**
> $$\text{Total Score} = (\text{Keyword Score} \times W_1) + (\text{URL Risk} \times W_2) + (\text{Sender Suspicion} \times W_3)$$

If the `Total Score` exceeds the threshold, the email is flagged. This logic allows for granular tuning to reduce false positives.
