Sometimes the AI would provide generic advice that didn’t match the specific constraints of the assignment (e.g., specific folder names), requiring me to double-check its suggestions against the lab manual.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflecting on this, I see GenAI not just as a coding assistant, but as a productivity multiplier. In my future Fintech career, I plan to use similar tools to: 1. Rapid Prototyping: Quickly spinning up dashboards for financial data visualization. 2.
